# daemon started from an initscript.
listen=YES
#
# If  enabled,  and  vsftpd was compiled with tcp_wrappers support, incoming
# connections will be fed through tcp_wrappers access control. Furthermore,

# and load the vsftpd configuration file specified in this variable.

# Uncomment this to enable any form of FTP write command.

#
userlist_enable=YES
#
# This option is examined if userlist_enable is activated. If you set this
